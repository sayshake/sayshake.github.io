# Installation

Clone this repo and it should run locally. 

For development you must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine. `cd` into the project, run `npm install` and then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.
